### this was supossed to be a calculator for school...

you would add you grades and it would tell you your average, how much you need to get in your future tests to pass, ect. <br>
however... i realized it wouldnt make any sense because everytime you entered the website, you would have to add all your grades again. <br>
for it to work the way i wanted it to, i would have to work with some sort of api and something like django.<br>
also, my school kinda changed their grading system so it wouldnt make sense to use this thing lol
